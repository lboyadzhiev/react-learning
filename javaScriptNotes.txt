Arrays

Which method do use when working with Arrays?

Start with a question: 

    What we want to do:

        Mutate the original array?

            -- Add to orinial:

                .push() - (end);
                .unshift() - (start);

            -- Remove from original:

                .pop() - (end);
                .shift() - (start);
                .splice() - (any);

            -- Others:

                .reverse();
                .sort();
                .fill()l;

        Create a new array?

            -- Computed from original:

                .map();
            
            -- Filtered using condition:

                .filter();

            -- Portion of original:

                .slice();

            -- Adding original to other:

                .concat();

            -- Flattening the original:

                .flat();
                .flatMap();

        Retrieve an array index?

            -- Based on value:

                .indexOf();

            -- Based on test condition:

                .findIndex();

        Retrieve an entryre array element?

            -- Based on test condition:

                .find();

        Know if array includes a sertain element?

            -- Based on value:

                .includes();

            -- Based on test condition:

                .some();
                .every();

        Get a new string?

            -- Based on separator string:

                .join();

        To transform to value?

            -- Based on accumulator:

                .reduce() - boil down array to single value of any type;

        To loop over the array?

            -- Based on callback:

                .forEach() - Does not create a new array just loop overt it, and it is not retunr any value;
